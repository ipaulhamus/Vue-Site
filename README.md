# Vue-Site

*What is it?* A simple SPA created using the Vue framework and bootstrap for styling. This page utilizes Vue's component-based structure to eliminate redundant HTML and create separation of concerns in the project. 
This site has three pages, including the following:

- Home: A home page that displays all of the site's contents. Includes two cards with buttons that have Vue router links to display the given pages.
- Guessing Game: A guessing game that allows the user to guess between 1 and 100 within 20 guesses. The game also allows the user to edit some parameters of the game, including the upper bound of the random number and the maximum number of guesses they have before they lose.
- About Page: A page that displays information about myself such as my name, my college username, and my GitHub.

Navigation between the "pages" in this SPA is handled by Vue's router, which mimics a multi-paged application by displaying different components to the user based on the routing link. This page demonstrates an understanding of the Vue framework and utilization of a component-based structure.
